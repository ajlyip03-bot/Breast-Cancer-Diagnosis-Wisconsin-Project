The main problem was whether a model can predict or diagnose breast cancer based on selected features. It involved identifying whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using selected features such as radius, texture, perimeter, and area of the tumor cells. The goal of this portfolio is to build a model that can predict the diagnosis based on these features effectively.<img width="468" height="77" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1636d9f2-ef68-4ccb-998e-831399697d45" />
